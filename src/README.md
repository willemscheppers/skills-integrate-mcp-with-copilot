## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

## Teacher Credentials

Teacher usernames/passwords are stored in `teachers.json` and validated by the backend.

Default examples:

- `mrs.johnson` / `algebra123`
- `mr.singh` / `science456`
